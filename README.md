# The care you need. The compassion you deserve
To narrow down the load on the offline health centres. Most of them were afraid to go outside of their homes. People were reluctant to go even for a routine checkup.The aim of this project is to provide an effective solution for the same. The patient has to enter the symptoms and then our Machine-Learning based Web Application will update them about the disease which they are suffering from and suggest some home remedies and medicines for the same. We will also notify the patient about the disease and its remedies and medicines with an SMS and E-MAIL notification. We have also provided a functionality which allows the patient to see the nearest hospital to this location. The main idea behind this project is to inform the patient about the disease he his suffering from and provide effective solutions to cure it and also to narrow down the load on the offline health centres, clinics and hospitals as well.

# Problem Statement
The lockdown that took place due to the Covid-19 all around the country had some severe impact on people. Most of them were afraid to go outside of their homes. People were reluctant to go even for a routine checkup.

# Proposed Solution
* So we come up with our own Disease Predicting System web application "MedLyfe".A simple,elegant website on which you can view the disease suffered by entering various symptoms.
* In this application, the patient must enter their symptoms, after which our Machine-Learning-based Web Application will inform them about the disease they are suffering from and recommend some home remedies and medications. 
* The application will also tell the patient about the disease and various treatments via SMS and E-MAIL.
* The application also has a feature that allows the patient to see the nearest hospital to their current location and book an appointment for the same
* The basic concept behind this project is to inform patients about the disease they are suffering from and provide appropriate options to cure it, as well as to reduce the burden on offline health centres, clinics, and hospitals.
